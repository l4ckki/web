                    Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been<br>
                    stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean<br>
                    towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over<br>
                    the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold<br>
                    that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a<br>
                    laughter more terrible than any sadness - laughter that was mirthless as the smile of<br>
                    the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was<br>
                    the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and<br>
                    the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.<br>                                
                </p>
                <p> 
                    But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a<br>
                    string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air<br>
                    as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of<br>
                    their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and<br>
                    leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without<br>
                    runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front<br>
                    end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of<br>
                    soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and<br>
                    narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled - blankets, an axe, and a coffee<br>
                    -pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and<br>
                    narrow oblong box.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a<br>
                    second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,a man whom<br>
                    the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again.<br>
                    It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is<br>
                    movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to<br>
                    prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their<br>
                    mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into<br>
                    submission man - man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum<br>
                    that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet<br>
                    dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks<br>
                    and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were<br>
                    not discernible. This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a<br>
                    spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating<br>
                    the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal<br>
                    adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and<br>
                    pulseless as the abysses of space.
